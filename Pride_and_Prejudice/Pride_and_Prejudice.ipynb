    "## An example of using Python for text analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can be used for a lot more than crunching big datasets of numbers, for example it can be used in the humanities/arts for the analysis of textual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will design and build some Python code to analyse Jane Austin's famous novel [*Pride and Prejudice*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice).\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may know, *Pride and Prejudice* deals with the stormy relationship between the heroine, Elizabeth Bennett, and Mr Darcy. Written in a pre-feminist era (1813), but by a female author and with a female lead, we could be interested in how the book manages the power balance between these two characters.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this very simple analysis, you will use Python to answer these questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Relatively how often are Elizabeth and Darcy's names mentioned?\n",
    "2) In sentences where both characters are mentioned, how often is Elizabeth's name mentioned first, and how many times is Darcy's name mentioned first?\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this task, you will write some Python functions. You will be provided with some tips on how to approach this, but the details are up to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full text of the book is available from the [Gutenberg Project](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342), but we have the text prepared for you already - you just need to download it. To do this, run the following cell:"
